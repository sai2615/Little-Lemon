# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Description

This project was built as part of Meta’s Front-End Development course on Coursera, serving as the capstone for the Front-End Development track.

It features a booking system seamlessly integrated into the Little Lemon website, constructed entirely with React components to demonstrate practical proficiency in React and the use of API calls for data handling.

Please note: aside from the visual design, the only interactive feature currently enabled is the “Reserve a Table” functionality.
